Contributing to Actpy
========================

TL;DR

* If you make a pull request do not create an issue! Use the PR description for that
* Issues are handled with a much lower priority than pull requests
* Use this [template](https://github.com/actpy/actpy)
  when reporting issues. Please search for duplicates first!
* Pull requests must be made against the correct version.
